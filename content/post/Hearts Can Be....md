Hello! This is the official blog of Fragile Hearts!

<!--more-->

Hi there everyone! My name is Jacob, I'm the creative director at Fragile Heart Games. Simply put, we're all about making the games we want to play. That we'd want to see made. 

Right now, we're working on a large project called Aoshima! Aoshima is a turn-based RPG with an ATB gauge and 21 different jobs! 

Right now we're developing it in GMS 1.4, though that may change as other options become available. 

We'll be sharing weekly(ish) updates to say and even show off what we're working on! For now though, we just want to say hello.

See ya next week!

-- Jacob
